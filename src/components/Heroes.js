DiCaprio was the first actor to be cast in the film. Nolan had been trying to work with the actor for years and met him several times, but was unable to convince him to appear in any of his films until Inception. Both Brad Pitt and Will Smith were offered the role, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Cobb\'s role is compared to "the haunted widower in a Gothic romance".'

Gordon-Levitt compared Arthur to the producer of Cobb\'s art, "the one saying, \'Okay, you have your vision; now I\'m going to figure out how to make all the nuts and bolts work so you can do your thing\'". The actor did all of his stunts but one scene and said the preparation "was a challenge and it would have to be for it to look real". James Franco was in talks with Christopher Nolan to play Arthur, but was ultimately unavailable due to scheduling conflicts.',

The name Ariadne alludes to a princess of Greek myth, daughter of King Minos, who aided the hero Theseus by giving him a sword and a ball of string to help him navigate the labyrinth which was the prison of the Minotaur. Nolan said that Page was chosen for being a "perfect combination of freshness and savvy and maturity beyond her years". Page said her character acts as a proxy to the audience, as "she\'s just learning about these ideas and, in essence, assists the audience in learning about dream sharing".'

Eames uses his ability to impersonate others inside the dream world in order to manipulate Fischer. Hardy described his character as "an old, Graham Greene-type diplomat; sort of faded, shabby, grandeur â€“ the old Shakespeare lovey mixed with somebody from Her Majesty\'s Special Forces", who wears "campy, old money" costumes.'

Nolan wrote the role with Watanabe in mind, as he wanted to work with him again after Batman Begins. Inception is Watanabe\'s first work in a contemporary setting where his primary language is English. Watanabe tried to emphasize a different characteristic of Saito in every dream level: "First chapter in my castle, I pick up some hidden feelings of the cycle. It\'s magical, powerful and then the first dream. And back to the second chapter, in the old hotel, I pick up [being] sharp and more calm and smart and it\'s a little bit [of a] different process to make up the character of any movie".'

Co-producer Jordan Goldberg said the role of the chemist was "particularly tough because you don\'t want him to seem like some kind of drug dealer", and that Rao was cast for being "funny, interesting and obviously smart".'

The actor also researched the sons of Rupert Murdoch, "to add to that the idea of living in the shadow of someone so immensely powerful".'
