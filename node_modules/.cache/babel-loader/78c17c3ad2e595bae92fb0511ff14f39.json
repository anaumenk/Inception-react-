Nolan had been trying to work with the actor for years and met him several times, but was unable to convince him to appear in any of his films until Inception. Both Brad Pitt and Will Smith were offered the role, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

The name Ariadne alludes to a princess of Greek myth, daughter of King Minos, who aided the hero Theseus by giving him a sword and a ball of string to help him navigate the labyrinth which was the prison of the Minotaur. Nolan said that Page was chosen for being a \"perfect combination of freshness and savvy and maturity beyond her years\".

Watanabe tried to emphasize a different characteristic of Saito in every dream level: \"First chapter in my castle, I pick up some hidden feelings of the cycle.
